# ITS Course Card Application

A simple, yet stupid application I made in my internship in ITS campus.

## Objective & Purposes

To help Subdirectorate of Joint Lecture Coordination in assigning student who wishes to retake their common courses or apply to take advanced common courses.

## How it works?

Just download `FRSFORGUI.java` alongside with `FRS.java` and you could run it. Heck, you can extract the `.jar` file to open the GUI.

## Closing Statement

Any suggestion or recommendations are like free real estates, don't hesitate to reach me out ðŸ’–
